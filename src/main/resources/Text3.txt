Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," 
and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."

So, we can define AI as:

"It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like a human, think like humans, 
and able to make decisions."
